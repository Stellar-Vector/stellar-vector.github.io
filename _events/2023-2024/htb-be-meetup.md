High time for some more hacking!

In two weeks, on **Thursday the 2nd of May**, we will host a Hack The Box Belgium Meetup at our campus.
These meetups, organized by three cybersecurity experts from Easi, are organized around once every month and are great resources to learn more about practical cybersecurity.
Two of the organizers will talk about windows security and guide you through hacking two windows machines May 2nd.

We'll hack from 19h to 22h, after which you can still stay for a drink and some discussions, if you want! 
Registration is mandatory and though Meetup so you can be given access to the HTB Belgium platform [https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-belgium/events/300284400/](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-belgium/events/300284400/)
