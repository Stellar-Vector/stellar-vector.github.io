On Wednesday the **11th of October 2023** at **18h30** *Stellar Vector* will organize CTF101, our annual start-to-hack event.

We will introduce the concept of CTFs and give an introduction to the team.
After this, some of our current members will guide you step by step through some custom challenges.
No worries if you have more experience, there will also be slightly more difficult challenges for you to try.

You **don't need any experience** in CTFs/software security/hacking in order to participate, we are all there to learn!
Joining is free, but registration is required. Please do so using [this form](https://forms.gle/vgwaA2jKBLLUBcTu9).
