On Monday the **3rd of October 2022** *Stellar Vector* will organize a starting event called CTF101 from **18h until 21h** in 200A 00.144 (registration is mandatory).

We will introduce the concept of CTFs (essentially solving mostly security-related challenges) and give an introduction to the team.
After this, some of our current members will guide you through some challenges that have been previously solved during a CTF we participated in.

You **don't need any experience** in CTFs/software security/hacking in order to participate, we are all there to learn!
We ask you to register upfront if you are going to join. Please do so using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1CV-iLJKEL65XVjywlDZxJ_WQacKATWCB6UCexoV6GsI2fQ/viewform).
