# CTF 101 - October 3rd

On Monday the **3rd of October** *Stellar Vector* will organize a starting event called CTF 101 from **18h until 21h** in 200A 00.144 (registration is mandatory).

We will introduce the concept of CTFs (essentially solving mostly security-related challenges) and give an introduction to the team.
After this, some of our current members will guide you through some challenges that have been previously solved during a CTF we participated in.

You **don't need any experience** in CTFs/software security/hacking in order to participate, we are all there to learn!
We ask you to register upfront if you are going to join. Please do so using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1CV-iLJKEL65XVjywlDZxJ_WQacKATWCB6UCexoV6GsI2fQ/viewform).

# Home

Welcome to the virtual home of ***Stellar Vector***, a primarily academic CTF team associated with KU Leuven, located in the beautiful town of Leuven (coincidentally also the home of the Stella beer).
***Stellar Vector*** is the reboot of HacknamStyle, which was the reboot of a CTF team by the name of: The Electronic Mayhem.
Just to say that weâ€™ve been participating in CTFs for well over a decade.
We welcome current and former students (bachelor, master, PhD) and any hacking aficionados located in Belgium, regardless of the level of expertise or experience.
We intend to participate in CTFs approximately on a monthly basis, and organize events to further improve (y)our hacking skills.
