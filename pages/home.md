# Home

Welcome to the virtual home of ***Stellar Vector***, a primarily academic CTF team associated with KU Leuven, located in the beautiful town of Leuven (coincidentally also the home of the Stella beer). ***Stellar Vector*** is the reboot of HacknamStyle, which was the reboot of a CTF team no one seems to remember the name of. Just to say that weâ€™ve been participating in CTFs for well over a decade. We welcome current and former students (bachelor, master, PhD) and any hacking aficionados, regardless of the level of expertise or experience. We intend to participate in CTFs approximately on a monthly basis, and organize events to further improve (y)our hacking skills.
