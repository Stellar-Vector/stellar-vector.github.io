# CTF 101 - October 11th

On Wednesday the **11th of October** at **18h30** *Stellar Vector* will organize CTF101, our annual start-to-hack event.

We will introduce the concept of CTFs and give an introduction to the team.
After this, some of our current members will guide you step by step through some custom challenges.
No worries if you have more experience, there will also be slightly more difficult challenges for you to try.

You **don't need any experience** in CTFs/software security/hacking in order to participate, we are all there to learn!
Joining is free, but registration is required. Please do so using [this form](https://forms.gle/vgwaA2jKBLLUBcTu9).

# Home

Welcome to the virtual home of ***Stellar Vector***, a primarily academic CTF team associated with KU Leuven, located in the beautiful town of Leuven (coincidentally also the home of the Stella beer).
***Stellar Vector*** is the reboot of HacknamStyle, which was the reboot of a CTF team by the name of: The Electronic Mayhem.
Just to say that weâ€™ve been participating in CTFs for well over a decade.
We welcome current and former students (bachelor, master, PhD) and any hacking aficionados located in Belgium, regardless of the level of expertise or experience.
We intend to participate in CTFs approximately on a monthly basis, and organize events to further improve (y)our hacking skills.
